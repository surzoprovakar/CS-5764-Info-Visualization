"This is the name of the field for ease of referring to it in documentation, communication, etc.","This field links to the shared standard, namespace, or specification for each element. This helps clarify the understanding of what the field means, as well as facilitates mapping that field to other metadata and MAPs.","This field represents where the field is mapped to in the application, system, or service. ",The expect resource or object type this metadata field is asserted against. Required if you're not going to split MAPs but need to specify fields that apply to only certain types of described resources.,"This is the expected metadata value for this field. Here you can specify data types (string, integer, datetime, etc.), specify value sources (controlled vocabularies, authorities, free-text entry, other), and any other specifications around the expected metadata (is identifier for an Agent resource; is a date following EDTF; is a Cornell email address; etc.)",This is the definition for the field.
